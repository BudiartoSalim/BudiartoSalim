ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m BudiartoSalim, you can just call me Budi!

I'm a web developer specializing in Javascript / Typescript. My main stack right now is Express and Postgresql for backend, and React for frontend. I've used Vue 2.0 too before, not for long though.

I also have an interest on game development. I've been learning game design and game development related stuffs on my freetime ever since when I still a college student at around the year 2012. I've also previously worked on several Unity Engine project using C#, although it's not in this Github profile I use for web development related stuff.

Fun fact is my first language is actually Pascal which was introduced to me during high school, but  the first language that I can actually use is C# which I learnt from university, and later deepened through Unity projects after I graduated. Now I focus more on web development stacks, and been enjoying Typescript recently. I've also tried Golang and Ruby (Rails) too before.

Right now I make web games using Javascript / Typescript for side projects as part hobby and to polish my skills in my free time too!
