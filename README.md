ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Budiarto, you can just call me Budi!

I'm a web developer specializing in Javascript / Typescript. My main stack right now is Express and Postgresql for backend, and React for frontend. I've used Vue 2.0 too before, not for long though.

I also have an interest on game development. I've been learning game design and game development related stuffs on my freetime ever since when I'm still a college student at Binus International University, around the year 2009 - 2013. I've also previously worked on several Unity Engine project using C#, although it's not in this Github profile because the Source Control we used back then was different.

Right now I make web games using Javascript / Typescript for side projects as part hobby and to polish my skills in my free time too!

You can reach me through this email: budiarto.salim91@gmail.com

# About my software engineering journey: 
My first language is actually Pascal which was introduced to me during high school and later C in my Programming 101 course on college, but to me the first language that actually counts and I can properly use is C# which I learnt from university on later semesters, which later also deepened through Unity projects that I've done with others after I graduated. Now I focus more on web development stacks, and been enjoying Typescript a lot. I've also tried Golang and Ruby (Rails) too before.
