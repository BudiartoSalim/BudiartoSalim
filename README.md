ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m BudiartoSalim, you can just call me Budi!

I'm a web developer specializing in Javascript / Typescript. My main stack right now is Express and Postgresql for backend, and React for frontend. I've used Vue 2.0 too before, not for long though.

I also have an interest on game development, I've previously worked on several Unity Engine project using C#, although it's not in this Github profile I use for web development related stuff.

Right now I make web games using Javascript / Typescript for side projects as part hobby and to polish my skills in my free time too!

You can reach me through this email: budiarto.salim91@gmail.com
